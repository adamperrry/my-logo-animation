# my-logo-animation
This small project was an [animation of a logo](https://adamperrry.github.io/my-logo-animation/) I designed for my potential future freelance brand. 

I used [this method](https://jakearchibald.com/2013/animated-line-drawing-svg/) for animating the SVG paths to get the drawing effect. I also wanted to add a small scale transition to the triangle polygon elements to make them "pop" into place, but SVG element origin coordinates shift with sclaing, meaning I would have to calculate a simulataneous translation, which seemed like too much work. I just stuck with a quick fade in!
